# revm helps you quickly run a lightweight Linux command-line environment

You donâ€™t need a bootable Linux image, nor do you need to install an entire distribution from a Linux ISO.  
All you need is a Linux rootfs to quickly launch a lightweight Linux command-line environment.

The rootfs can be obtained from a `docker export`, and you can even directly launch a statically compiled Linux ELF executable.  
This makes revm interesting to play with in many scenarios.

## Run a Linux shell in 1 second
```shell
# download alpine rootfs
$ wget https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.21/releases/aarch64/alpine-minirootfs-3.21.3-aarch64.tar.gz
$ mkdir ~/alpine_rootfs && tar -xvf -C ~/alpine_rootfs

# run a shell
./revm --rootfs ~/alpine_rootfs --  /bin/sh

```

# Binary signing issues on MacOS

MacOS does not allow running external binaries, so you have to build re-vm from source code or sign the binary manually. 

For build the binary from the source code. you need to have golang development environment (using [brew](https://brew.sh)), and run the build script:
```shell
./build.sh # run build script
```

Or download binaries from release, and remove `com.apple.quarantine` for binaries.
```shell
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./bin/revm-arm64
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./lib/*
```
